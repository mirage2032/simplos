# simplos

A small x86_64 operating system written in Rust, from the boot sector up. It
brings up long mode, a GDT and IDT, paging and a heap, a PS/2 keyboard, the
HPET, and draws a status screen into a linear framebuffer. It boots under both
BIOS and UEFI firmware, on real hardware or an emulator — including
[in a browser tab](https://lazyscript.com/projects/simplos), where QEMU itself
is compiled to WebAssembly.

Nothing here is `std`. The kernel is `#![no_std]`, built for
`x86_64-unknown-none` with a rebuilt `core`, and the toolchain is a pinned
nightly (`rust-toolchain.toml`) because `build-std`, artifact dependencies and
`abi_x86_interrupt` are all still unstable.

## Running it

```sh
cd fullkernel
cargo run              # UEFI
cargo run -- --bios    # BIOS
cargo run -- --debug   # wait for a debugger on :1234 before the first instruction
```

`fullkernel` is not part of the OS: it is a host program whose build script
turns the kernel into two bootable disk images and whose `main` starts QEMU on
one of them. It uses KVM when `/dev/kvm` is there and falls back to software
emulation when it isn't, so it works on a machine or a CI runner either way.
Any other argument is passed straight through to QEMU.

A release's images need none of this — download `bios.img` or `uefi.img` from
[the latest release](../../releases/latest) and boot it.

## Resolution

Both images come up at **1920x1080** and the kernel will narrow that on request:

```sh
cargo run -- -fw_cfg name=opt/simplos/fb,string=1024x768
```

Which is worth explaining, because the two firmware paths get there very
differently. The mode is chosen *before* the kernel exists — UEFI through the
GOP, BIOS through a VESA call in the bootloader's 16-bit real-mode second stage —
and neither can be told anything at runtime. So the built-in mode is a build-time
constant, `SIMPLOS_FB_WIDTH` / `SIMPLOS_FB_HEIGHT`, read by both `kernel/build.rs`
and the vendored bootloader's `bios/stage-2/build.rs` so the UEFI minimum and the
BIOS cap cannot drift apart.

The runtime request is a different mechanism: the kernel reads
`opt/simplos/fb` from QEMU's fw_cfg device (`kernel/src/io/fwcfg.rs`) and sets
the mode itself through the Bochs VBE registers (`kernel/src/io/video/vbe.rs`).

**It can only make the framebuffer smaller.** The bootloader maps exactly
`FrameBufferInfo::byte_len` bytes of video memory and nothing later maps more, so
a larger mode would write past the end of the mapping. A request that doesn't
fit is refused and the firmware's mode kept — which is also what happens on real
hardware, where those registers don't exist.

One 1920x1080 image therefore serves everyone, the browser build included.

## Tests

```sh
cd kernel
cargo test
```

Every test is a kernel. They are built for the bare-metal target with no `main`
and no libtest, so `tools/boot-test` stands in as cargo's test runner: it wraps
each test binary in a bootable image, starts QEMU, and turns how the guest shut
itself down back into a pass or a fail. The guest's side of that is QEMU's
`isa-debug-exit` device — writing to its port makes QEMU exit with a status
derived from the value written.

`scripts/smoke-test.sh` is the coarser check, and the one that catches the most:
it boots the real images both ways and asserts the kernel's boot banner names
the right firmware and the right framebuffer mode.

## Layout

| | |
|---|---|
| `kernel/` | the OS. A `no_std` library plus the binary that draws the screen. |
| `fullkernel/` | host-side: builds the disk images, runs QEMU. |
| `tools/boot-test/` | cargo's test runner for the kernel's bare-metal tests. |
| `vendor/bootloader/` | [rust-osdev/bootloader](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader) 0.11.17, vendored and patched. |
| `vendor/ps2/` | the `ps2` crate, with its `x86_64` dependency bumped. |
| `scripts/` | `build-images.sh`, `smoke-test.sh`, `boot-test.sh`. |

There is no cargo workspace: `kernel` builds for `x86_64-unknown-none` with
`build-std`, the other two build for the host, and the settings for those are
mutually exclusive. Each crate has its own `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`,
`.cargo/config.toml` and target directory — so a `[patch]` added to one has to
be added to the others that need it.

### The vendored bootloader

`vendor/bootloader` is upstream 0.11.17 with three local changes, each marked
`LOCAL PATCH` in the source:

- **`bios/stage-2/build.rs`** and **`bios/stage-2/src/main.rs`** — the VESA mode
  cap comes from `SIMPLOS_FB_WIDTH` / `SIMPLOS_FB_HEIGHT` instead of being
  hardcoded.
- **`build.rs`** — declares those two variables as build inputs. Without it the
  nested `cargo install` runs that build the BIOS stages are never re-invoked
  when they change, and a stale stage-2 is silently reused with the old cap
  compiled in.
- **`uefi/src/main.rs`** — prefers an exact GOP mode match before falling back
  to upstream's "first mode at least this large".

Its build is unusual and worth knowing about before debugging it: `build.rs`
shells out to five nested `cargo install --locked` runs to build four real-mode
BIOS stages and the UEFI loader, each for its own custom target with its own
rebuilt `core`. They go to `vendor/bootloader/target`, a fourth target directory.
Because they are `--locked`, editing a vendored manifest without updating
`vendor/bootloader/Cargo.lock` fails *inside a build script*, where the error is
easy to misread.

## Branches

`develop` is the default branch and where work lands, through pull requests that
CI checks. `master` is only ever moved by the **Promote to master** workflow,
which re-runs the checks at the commit it is about to release, bumps the version,
fast-forwards both branches to it, tags it `vX.Y.Z` and publishes a GitHub
Release with both disk images attached.

So: branch from `develop`, open a pull request into `develop`, and release by
running Promote to master from the Actions tab.

### What the branch rules do and don't enforce

Both branches have a ruleset that refuses **force-pushes and deletion** — the
two things that lose work irrecoverably. Repository admins can bypass them, so
you can't lock yourself out.

Neither enforces "must go through a pull request with a passing check", and that
is a deliberate trade, not an omission. Promote pushes the release commit
*straight* to both branches, and a `pull_request` or `required_status_checks`
rule rejects a direct push — including a clean fast-forward, and including one
from Actions itself:

    remote: - Changes must be made through a pull request.
    remote: - Required status check "check" is in progress.

The usual answer is to give the workflow's token a bypass, but a ruleset bypass
actor can only be an app on a repository owned by an *organisation*; on a
user-owned repository the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot be granted one. So
enforcing it would mean giving up the automatic version bump, or giving the job
a personal access token or deploy key held as a secret and added as a bypass
actor. Until then the pull request flow is a convention — CI still runs on every
one, and promote refuses to release if master has commits develop doesn't.
